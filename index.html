    <h4>What does she get up to outside of work?</h4>
    <p>Haleigh and her software engineer husband Patrick enjoy walking a few short blocks from their old Minneapolis home to the restauraunts along Eat Street, and biking to the nearby downtown area for various adventures. They dote on their giant Great Pyrenees, Thyra, and two little cats, Quentin Tarantino and Jiji. She also creates stained glass art, cooks, gardens, and studies too many languages in her spare time.</p>
